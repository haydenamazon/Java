Wednesday: create method "printCard" in order to create a method that displays the content of the card. 
Friday: Work on method that declares a random number non repeated number that changes the value from the array into a zero and then into an "X"
The weekend: work on "checkWin" method and check all the dimensions like horizontal, vertical, and both diagonals.
The rest of the time: work out bugs and anything I did not get around to finish or make clean.
